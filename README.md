# Tic Tac Toe Ai
A console based Tic Tac Toe game including an unbeatbale AI using the minimax algorithm.

### Usage
To play the game run the `game.py` file or the `main()` function. <br />
If you want to add the algorithm to your own project, you can download the `minimax.py` file and run `get_move()`. <br />
`get_move()` takes two arguments:
 - the current board state as a list of strings (e.g. ['', 'X', '', 'O' ...])
 - the symbol of the AI player (either 'X' or 'O')
